The Mom Test for your web3 ideas to help you scale better for the next billion users

# Description

This project helps in  validating your web3 ideas so that you can know whether it makes sense to next 100 users... before aiming for 10 billion. You can essentially add ideas or vote on them, based on two thoughts that come to your mind when you see them -- "HMM" or "GAS". Former means the idea may be good, but it isn't clear, while later means the idea is super clear + it's gonna explode. The main goal of this project is to solve the on-boarding process of dApps by making more sense out of them.
